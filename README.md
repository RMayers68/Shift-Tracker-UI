# Shift-Tracker-UI

Function: User Console App that lets workers input their shifts and view shift history. It interacts with the Shift Tracker API that I created.

How it Went Making this Program: Compared to the API, this was the easy portion of this project. I had a small hiccup deserializing JSON objects, but I found out that
the first time I worked with JSON objects, it was one JSON object that was an array of other JSON objects. Whereas in my API, it was simply several JSON objects. After
I solved this problem, I weas easily able to implemt the CRUD commands needed for the program to function.
